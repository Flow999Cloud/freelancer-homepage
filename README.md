A work-in-progress by @gbezyuk.

At this step we implement the frontend app with WebPack, using vue-hackernews-2.0 configuration as a reference.
At the same time we provide backend/API/admin application built with Django. 

For a frontend-only version see older repository tags.

For a static version see older repository tags.
